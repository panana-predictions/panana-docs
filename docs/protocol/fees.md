# Fees

Panana Predictions employs a transparent fee structure to ensure the sustainability and fairness of the prediction marketplace. Below is a breakdown of the different fees and their purposes.

## Marketplace Fees

### **1.5% Transaction Fee**
A **1.5% fee** is applied to every transaction (buy/sell). This fee is used to maintain and operate the marketplace, covering:
- Infrastructure costs
- Market curation
- Market resolution processes

### **1.5% Liquidity Provider Fee**
A **1.5% fee** is allocated to liquidity providers. This fee compensates liquidity providers for their risk, as they may experience losses due to unbalanced or low-volume markets.

### **5% Fee for Holding Until Resolution**
A **5% fee** is charged **ONLY IF** a market participant holds their shares until the market is resolved. This incentivizes users to sell their shares before market resolution, reducing risks for liquidity providers and ensuring better market liquidity.

:::warning
Fees are not final and may change at any time during the market's beta phase.

## Oracle Challenge Cost

If a user wishes to challenge a market resolution through the decentralized reputation oracle, they must pay a **one-time cost of 500 USDC** to summon the oracle committee. This process ensures fairness in disputed outcomes while preventing frivolous challenges.
