# Tokens: XP and USDC

## What is \$XP?

\$XP is a **fungible and soulbound asset token** on the Aptos blockchain, designed to represent a user's reputation and ranking within the Panana Predictions ecosystem. Unlike regular fungible tokens, \$XP is **non-transferable**, meaning it cannot be bought, sold, or traded between users. This makes it a **true representation of a userâ€™s engagement and success** in prediction markets.

## What Does It Mean to Be Soulbound?

A **soulbound token (SBT)** is a blockchain-based asset that is permanently tied to a specific wallet. This means that:

- \$XP **cannot be transferred** to another address.
- The token **stays with the user**, reflecting their activity and achievements in the prediction market.
- The amount of \$XP in a userâ€™s wallet serves as a **reputation metric** within the ecosystem.

## Use Cases of \$XP

\$XP plays a key role in the Panana Predictions platform by providing **non-monetary incentives** and recognizing users' contributions:

### 1. **Global Leaderboard & Reputation**

- Users earn \$XP for participating in prediction markets, regardless of whether they win or lose.
- The amount of \$XP a user holds determines their **ranking on the global leaderboard**.
- Higher \$XP levels showcase a user's **skill and experience**, making them more reputable in the community.

### 2. **Future Gov**ernance & Privileges

- In the future, users with high \$XP may receive governance rights or decision-making influence within the platform.
- Special privileges and **exclusive features** may be unlocked for top-ranked users.

### 3. **Event & Competition Rewards**

- \$XP could be used to **grant access to exclusive events**, tournaments, or specialized prediction markets.
- Certain competitions may require a minimum amount of \$XP to participate.

### 4. **Potential Additional Utility**

- Panana Predictions may introduce **further utility for \$XP** in upcoming features and ecosystem developments.
- The token's use cases will continue to expand based on **community governance and future upgrades**.

## How to Earn \$XP

- **Participate in prediction markets** (whether winning or losing, users gain \$XP).
- **Engage with the platform consistently** to accumulate reputation over time.
- **Compete in special events** where additional \$XP rewards may be granted.

\$XP ensures that Panana Predictions remains **a skill-based, meritocratic ecosystem**, where reputation and expertise are earned rather than bought. ðŸš€
