# Decentralized Reputation Oracle

## 1. Overview

The **Decentralized Reputation Oracle** is a transparent, trust-based resolution mechanism used in Panana Predictions to ensure fair and reliable market outcomes. It functions as a **governance-driven, multi-signature** system where a **committee of reputable individuals** determines disputed market results.

## 2. Governance Mechanism

- The oracle operates **fully on-chain** through smart contracts.
- A **committee** is formed with an **odd number of members**, ensuring that a definitive resolution can always be reached.
- The **size of the committee** can be adjusted via a **governance proposal**, voted on by the existing committee members.
- All governance actions, including membership adjustments and parameter changes, are executed in a **decentralized manner** through smart contracts.

## 3. Committee and Voting System

- The committee members were selected based on their **strong reputations** within the community. Their incentive is to vote fairly, as **any biased or incorrect resolutions would damage their trustworthiness**.
- The oracle functions similarly to a **multi-signature account**, where **each committee member votes** on the disputed outcome.
- Since the committee has an **odd number of participants**, there will **always be a definitive resolution**, preventing deadlocks.

Commitee members will be announced in the near future.

## 4. Summoning the Oracle

- Users can **summon the oracle** by paying a **fixed fee (X USDC)**.
- This fee acts as a deterrent against unnecessary disputes and helps cover operational costs.
- The **fee amount can be modified** by a governance proposal initiated by the committee.

## 5. Transparency and Trust

- All committee members and their decisions are **publicly recorded on-chain**, ensuring **full transparency**.
- Users can verify past rulings and the voting history of committee members.
- The system is designed to be **community-driven**, with future improvements and changes governed by **decentralized proposals**.

The **Decentralized Reputation Oracle** ensures fairness, eliminates conflicts of interest, and provides a ****transparent and verifiable**** resolution mechanism for Panana Predictions.
