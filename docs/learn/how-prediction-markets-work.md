# How Prediction Markets Work

## The Technical Mechanics of Prediction Markets
Prediction markets leverage financial incentives and market mechanisms to aggregate collective intelligence. By allowing participants to trade shares representing different outcomes, they enable real-time forecasting of future events based on market sentiment.

## The Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Market Creation and Liquidity Provision
When a new prediction market is created:

- A question is defined, such as "Who will win the next U.S. presidential election?"
- The market is structured with possible outcomes (e.g., "Candidate A" and "Candidate B")
- Liquidity providers or the platform ensure an initial balance of shares to facilitate trading

### 2. Buying and Selling Shares
Once the market is live:

- Participants purchase shares in an outcome they believe is most likely to happen
- The price of each share reflects the probability of the event occurring, determined by supply and demand
- As more people buy shares in one outcome, its price increases, signaling higher confidence in that result
- Participants can sell shares at any time to adjust their positions before the event concludes

### 3. Settlement and Payouts
After the event outcome is determined:

- The market resolves based on verifiable external sources (e.g., official election results)
- Winning shares pay out at a fixed value ($1 per share), while losing shares become worthless
- Participants who held winning shares receive their payouts, finalizing the market

## The Role of Smart Contracts
Blockchain-based prediction markets rely on smart contracts to automate operations securely:

- **Market Contract:** Handles market creation, liquidity, and trade execution
- **Oracle Contract:** Provides a verifiable source of truth for determining outcomes
- **Oracle Contract:** Provides a verifiable source of truth for determining outcomes

These contracts ensure transparency, minimize the need for intermediaries, and allow permissionless participation.

## Market Integrity and Security
A critical aspect of prediction markets is maintaining trust and security:

- **Reliable Oracles:** Ensuring accurate event resolution through decentralized oracles or trusted third parties
- **Manipulation Resistance:** Preventing market manipulation through robust design, security audits and monitoring
- **Liquidity Incentives:** Encouraging participation through rewards for market makers and traders

## The Economics of Prediction Markets
Prediction markets introduce unique economic dynamics:

- **Price as a Probability Indicator:** Market prices represent collective probability estimates of an outcome occurring
- **Arbitrage Opportunities:** Traders can exploit mispricings when similar markets exist on different platforms
- **Fee Models:** Like many platforms, we charge a small fee on trades to sustain operations
