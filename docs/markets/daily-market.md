# Daily Markets

## 1. Overview
Daily markets in Panana Predictions allow users to predict on a variety of topics, including sports, politics, and weather. A new market is created **every day**, providing continuous opportunities for engagement and rewards.

## 2. Market Creation
- A **new market is created daily**, ensuring fresh prediction opportunities.
- Markets cover a diverse range of topics, from **sports and politics to weather and global events**.
- Users can only predict on the **next available 24-hour market**.

## 3. How Predictions Work
- Users enter a market by selecting an outcome within the **24-hour prediction window**.
- All predictions share a **common pool**, and winners earn rewards **proportional to their input**.
- Users can participate in multiple markets but can only predict **on the next day's market**.

## 4. Market Lifecycle
- **Market Opens:** A new market is automatically created daily.
- **Prediction Phase:** Users can submit predictions for **the next 24 hours**.
- **Market Closes:** Once the 24-hour period ends, no further predictions can be made.
- **Resolution Phase:** The market outcome is determined within **24 hours** by a **committee of judges**.
- **Claiming Rewards:** Rewards can be claimed immediately **after the resolution**.

## 5. Market Resolution
- Markets are **resolved fully decentralized** within **24 hours** after closing.
- A **committee of judges** determines the final outcome.
- The committee is currently defined by **Panana**, but will be **governed by the community in the future**.
- If resolution is **not possible** (e.g., a sports event was canceled), **all users receive their initial stake back**.
- Each event has **clear resolution rules and verifiable sources**.

## 6. Risks & Considerations
- **Market Uncertainty:** Unexpected events (e.g., match cancellations) can lead to refunds instead of payouts.
- **Decentralized Resolution Risks:** The governance of the resolution process will transition over time.
- **Smart Contract Risks:** As a blockchain-based platform, users should be aware of potential vulnerabilities.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Users must ensure participation aligns with their local regulations.

## 7. Fees
- No fees for market creation or participation.

## 8. Example Use Case
**Example: Predicting a Soccer Match Outcome**
- Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Dave enter the daily market, each betting **\$50**.  
- Alice and Charlie predict that **Team A will win**, while Bob and Dave predict that **Team A will lose**.  
- After **24 hours**, the prediction phase closes.  
- Within **24 hours**, the judge committee verifies the match result.  
- **Outcome:** Team A wins.  
- The total pool is **\$200** (Alice: $50, Charlie: $50, Bob: $50, Dave: $50).  
- Since Bob and Dave were on the losing side, their **\$100** is redistributed to the winning pool (minus **3% performance fee**, fees are subject to change).  
- The fee deducted is **\$3**, leaving **\$97** for Alice and Charlie.  
- Since Alice and Charlie contributed equally, they each receive **\$48.50** in winnings, plus their initial **\$50 stake**, totaling **\$98.50** each.  
- If the match is **canceled**, all participants receive their initial **\$50** stake back.
