# Crypto Markets

## 1. Overview
Crypto markets in Panana Predictions allow users to predict short-term price movements of cryptocurrency pairs. These markets are designed for fast-paced, high-frequency predictions where users can earn rewards based on the accuracy of their forecasts.

## 2. Market Creation
- Crypto markets are created dynamically as soon as the first user participates in the market.
- There is no pre-determined list of markets; new markets are continuously formed based on user activity.

## 3. How Predictions Work
- Crypto markets operate in predefined periods of **6 minutes**.
- Users always predict on the next available period.
- Once a period starts, no further predictions can be made for that timeframe.
- Users can make predictions on supported trading pairs, such as **APT/USDT** (additional pairs may be introduced in the future).
- The market functions as a **pool-based system**; all users who predicted correctly share the winnings proportionally to their input in the winning pool.

## 4. Market Lifecycle
- **Market Entry:** Users enter predictions by choosing an outcome before the period starts.
- **Trading Phase:** No further entries once the period begins.
- **Resolution:** At the end of the period, the market outcome is determined.
- **Claiming Rewards:** Users who predicted correctly can immediately claim their winnings.
- **XP Rewards:** All participants earn **$XP tokens**, regardless of whether they win or lose.

## 5. Market Resolution
- Crypto markets resolve **automatically** using **Pyth oracles**, ensuring accurate and decentralized price feeds.
- Users can claim their rewards as soon as the period ends.

## 6. Risks & Considerations
- **Market Volatility:** Crypto prices can be highly volatile, affecting predictions.
- **Smart Contract Risks:** While the system is decentralized, users should be aware of potential risks in smart contract execution.
- **Liquidity Risks:** Users must be aware that funds are locked for the duration of each prediction period.
- **Risk of Permanent Loss:** Users must be aware that they will loose all their funds if they predicted the wrong outcome.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Users are responsible for ensuring they comply with applicable regulations in their jurisdiction.

## 7. Fees
- A **3% performance fee** applies to winning payouts.
- No fees for market creation or participation.

## 8. Example Use Cases
**Example 1: Predicting APT/USDT Price Movement**
- Alice, Bob, and Charlie enter a prediction for APT/USDT, each betting **$100**.  
- Alice and Bob predict that the price will go **up**, while Charlie predicts that the price will go **down**.  
- When the period ends, the price is higher than at the start.  
- The total pool is **$300** (Alice: $100, Bob: $100, Charlie: $100).  
- Since Charlie was on the losing side, his **$100** goes to the winning pool (minus the **3% performance fee**).  
- The fee deducted is **$3**, leaving **$97** to be distributed to Alice and Bob.  
- Since Alice and Bob contributed equally, they each receive **$48.50** in winnings, plus their initial **$100 stake**, totaling **$148.50** each, as well as **$XP tokens** for participation. 
- Charlie loses his bet but still earns **$XP tokens** for participation.
